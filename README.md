Setup the UI and initiazing with dummy data just making sure everything is alright before fetching real data from
the web. 
The UI is a GridView with two columns. Every row has two images with TextView over each.
I had to make a custome ImageView which maintains its aspect ratio (keep square aspect ration for each ImageView)
